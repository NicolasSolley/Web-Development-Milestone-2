Additionally, Cobb and Douglas Public Health and Community Organized Relief Effort are offering free testing on both campuses. Below are the COVID-19 testing options for students, faculty and staff.

    <h3>Sanitation</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin: 0px 20px; font-size: 20px;">KSU has taken great steps to train and equip the staff responsible for the cleaning and sanitization of facilities around campus and developed protocols that will allow for consistent, multiple cleanings daily for high-traffic areas including classrooms, restrooms, building lobbies and residence halls. Additional hand sanitizing stations have been placed throughout campus and cleaning supplies will be readily available in the classrooms so you can wipe down your desk before and after use.

  <h3>Face Covering</h3>
  
    <p style="text-align: center; margin: 0px 20px; font-size: 20px;">As a reminder, all students, faculty, staff and visitors are required to wear an appropriate face covering inside campus facilities/buildings. For students and faculty, this includes the requirement to wear a face covering while in the classroom. Face covering use is in addition to and is not a substitute for social distancing.
